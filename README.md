# fswatch
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/codeskyblue/fswatch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/codeskyblue/fswatch)

**fswatch** is a command line tool. Watch file change and trigger commands.

This version is works well on **Mac**,**Linux** and also **Windows**.

## Install

	go get -u github.com/codeskyblue/fswatch

## How to use

1. First create a config file, the command bellow.

	fswatch init

A config file `.fwc.yml` will be created, for example

```
desc: Auto generated by fswatch [fswatch]
triggers:
- pattens:
  - '*.go'
  - '*.c'
  env:
    DEBUG: "1"
  cmd: go test -v
  delay: 100ms
  signal: ""
watch_paths:
- .
watch_depth: 5
```

2. Run `fswatch` directly

```
$ fswatch
fswatch >>> exec start: go test -v
# github.com/codeskyblue/fswatch
./fswatch.go:281: main redeclared in this block
	previous declaration at ./config.go:354
fswatch >>> program exited: exit status 2
fswatch >>> finish in 145.499911ms
```

Every time you edit a file. Command `go test -v` will be called.

More about the pattens. The patten has the same rule like `.gitignore`

So you can write like this.

```
- pattens:
  - '*.go'
  - '!*_test.go'
  - '!*/*/bindata.go'
```

`main.go` changed will trigger command, but `a_test.go` and `libs/bindata.go` will be ignored.

## Troubles
`too many open files`

For mac, run the following command

    sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=20480
    sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=18000
    ulimit -S -n 2048

* `Ctrl+C` will trigger fswatch quit and kill all process it started.

## Code History
I reviewed the first version of fswatch(which was taged 0.1). The code I look now is shit. So I deleted almost 80% code, And left some very useful functions.
