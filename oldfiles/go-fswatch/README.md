## fswatch upgrade plan
Thanks for lot of users of fswatch. I never thought this small tools chould got so much users. Very happy really.

In order to get it better. I got some plans to make a new fswatch.

1. use `.fswatch.yml` instead of `.fswatch.json`

	Because yaml is more good to edit than json file

2. Auto detect repo language, and select the right filter plan.

	If lang is go, then only care about `.go` files

3. More tests
4. Use latest dependencies
